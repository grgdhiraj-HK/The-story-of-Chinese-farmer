        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<q class=Neighbour><i>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</i></q></p>
        <p1> The farmer said,<q class=Farmer> <i>Maybe.</i></p1>
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <i><q class=Neighbour>Oh, isn&apos;t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</i> The farmer again said, <q class=Farmer><i>Maybe.</i></q></p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class=Neighbour>Oh dear, that&apos;s too <span class="Bad"> bad</span>,</i></q> and the farmer responded, <q class=Farmer><i>Maybe.</i></q> </p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class=Neighbour>Isn&apos;t that great!</i></q> Again, he said, <q class=Farmer><i>Maybe.</i></q></p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it&apos;s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="Good"> good </span>or <span class="Bad"> bad</span> &#9472; because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune..</p4>

       <blockquote class="conclusion"> <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Bad"> bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="Good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="Good">good</span>for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p></blockquote>
